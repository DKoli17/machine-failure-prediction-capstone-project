# 🔧 Machine Failure Prediction – Data Analytics Capstone Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of my **Data Analytics Internship**.  
The objective is to predict machine failures using historical sensor and operational data, helping organizations reduce downtime and maintenance costs.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Unplanned machine failures lead to high operational losses.  
This project aims to:
- Analyze machine sensor data
- Identify failure patterns
- Build a predictive model to anticipate failures in advance

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains machine operational parameters such as:
- Temperature
- Rotational speed
- Torque
- Tool wear
- Failure labels

*(Dataset used only for educational and analytical purposes.)*

---

## 🔍 Approach
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature selection  
4. Model building and evaluation  
5. Performance comparison

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models
- Logistic Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- (Add others if used)

---

## 📈 Results
- Achieved improved prediction accuracy for machine failure detection
- Random Forest performed best among tested models *(edit if needed)*
